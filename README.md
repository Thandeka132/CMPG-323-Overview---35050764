# CMPG-323-Overview---35050764

This a repository for project 1 and an overview for the other projects. The rest of the projects (Project 2, 3, 4 and the POE) will use their own repositories.

The Branching strategy that will be used in this project is GitHub flow which will allow me to start off with the main branch the create branches that come from the main. With these branches that come from the main, I can isolate them and work on them separately and then merge them back into the main branch once everything is completed.

For each project, there will be the use of a .gitignore file in each project so that Git can ignore certain files or directories whenever I make a commit.

For Project 2 onwards, I will be using  a SECURITY.MD file that will state the security policies related to my projects. I will also be invalidating or removing any sensisitive information such as passwords. I can also use GitHub Credential Manager to securely store my credentials.
